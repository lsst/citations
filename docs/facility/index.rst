Facility
========

To cite the Rubin Observatory system as a whole, including the design of the observatory, telescope, camera, and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), use the following publication.

- "LSST: From Science Drivers to Reference Design and Anticipated Data Products", `Ivezić et al. (2019) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...873..111I/abstract>`_


AAS facility codes
------------------

When publishing Rubin Observatory results in AAS journals (AJ, ApJ, ApJL, ApJS), authors must include a “Facilities” section identifying the observatories and data archives used in their research.
The following official facility codes should be used when citing Rubin Observatory data and Rubin-hosted data access services.

**Rubin:Simonyi** — Simonyi Survey Telescope

**Rubin:USDAC** — U.S. Data Access Center (US DAC)

For example, include the following in publication manuscripts.

::

   Facilities: Rubin:Simonyi, Rubin:USDAC
