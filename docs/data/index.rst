Data Preview 1 (DP1)
====================

When citing the DPI dataset as a whole, use the following DOI.

*Dataset* |dataset_doi| [:download:`BibTeX <../bib/dataset.bib>`]

- **DOI:** 10.71929/RUBIN/2570308
- **Title:** Legacy Survey of Space and Time Data Preview 1
- **URL:** https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2570308
- **Year:** 2025

**DOIs for each data product:**
In addition to the primary data release DOI listed above, individual DOIs are assigned for each specific dataset type, image type, catalog, and derived data product.
When a more specific DOI exists for the dataset you used, cite that DOI in preference to the broader data release DOI.
Primary DOIs are intended to describe an entire data release, while dataset‑specific DOIs provide more precise attribution for particular data products.
See the `DP1 data release documentation <https://dp1.lsst.io>`_ for DOIs by data product.


Data Preview 0 (DP0)
====================

A single DOI was not issued for the simulated datasets that were released as part of Data Preview 0.
Use the appropriate citations for the individual DP0 release, as listed below.


Data Preview 0.3 (DP0.3)
------------------------

Papers based on the DP0.3 simulation should use this acknowledgement statement.

- The DP0.3 data set was generated by members of the Rubin Solar System Pipelines and Commissioning teams, with help from the LSST Solar System Science Collaboration, in particular: Pedro Bernardinelli, Jake Kurlander, Joachim Moeyens, Samuel Cornwall, Ari Heinze, Steph Merritt, Lynne Jones, Siegfried Eggl, Meg Schwamb, Grigori Fedorets, and Mario Juric.


Data Preview 0.2 (DP0.2)
------------------------

The data set used for DP0.2 is the 300 square deg of simulated, LSST-like images and catalogs generated by the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) for their Data Challenge 2 (DC2).

Papers based on the DP0.2 simulation should cite the following publications.

- "CosmoDC2: A Synthetic Sky Catalog for Dark Energy Science with LSST", `Korytov et al. (2019) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..245...26K/abstract>`_
- "The LSST DESC DC2 Simulated Sky Survey", `LSST DESC (2021) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..253...31L/abstract>`_
- "DESC DC2 Data Release Note", `LSST DESC Release Note (2021) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210104855L/abstract>`_


Data Preview 0.1 (DP0.1)
------------------------

Papers based on the DP0.1 simulation should cite the same publications as DP0.2, above.
