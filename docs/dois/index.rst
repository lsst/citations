- include list of DOIs


In addition to the primary data release DOIs listed above, Rubin Observatory assigns DOIs to specific dataset types, catalogs, and derived data products.
When a more specific DOI exists for the dataset you used, cite that DOI in preference to the broader data release DOI.
Primary DOIs are intended to describe an entire data release, while dataset‑specific DOIs provide more precise attribution for particular data products.
